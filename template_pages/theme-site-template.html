			<p>Hey, what's up everybody? Welcome to what I consider to be my first 'real' website! What I mean by that is, I've constructed and customized several generated websites from web-hosting services before; however, unlike those previous websites, this is the first website that I have built from the ground up by writing the code for it.</p>
            <p>I have several purposes for this site. I hope to use this website as a general hub for things I do on the web. I used to design texture hacks for Super Smash Bros. Brawl over at Brawl Vault, and I have recently began to write CSS Styles over at Userstyles.org. Anyway, I want to use this site to connect my projects like these at one central location. As a matter of fact, this site itself is practice for me and a place for me to sharpen my web development abilities. I plan for this to be an ongoing project for a while at least, so you can probably expect to see some changes around here sooner or later.</p>
            <p>There's not much here to look at currently, nevertheless, thank you for visiting my site! If you're reading this on March 21, 2014, then you are among the very first visitors to this site.</p>
            <p>Oh and also, thanks to my friend Owstin (AKA BigGreen) for directing me to GitHub so I could upload this site.</p>
            <p>-Leon</p>
